*How to play the Game*

NOTE: This is a very basic version of the Frogger game.

You have launched the game successfully if you see a rectangular screen, consisting of three major sections: a grassy area,  three paved lanes - accross which Bugs (Enemies) are moving left-to-right in various speeds, and a pool.

Your goal is to move the Player standing on the lawn, across the paved lanes into the water, without colliding with any of the Bugs. 

Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the Player. Should the Player collide with any of the Bugs, the Player is sent back to the starting position.
